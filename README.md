# [AI Personalities for Skirmish and Multiplayer]

This mod works with both Planetary Annihilation and Planetary Annihilation Titans. It introduces a number of new personalities for the vanilla AI, based off the Absurd difficulty level. These personalities will work with faction mods such as Legion. Installing the Queller AI will not interfere with this mod.

## [Installation]

You should download and install this mod via the Planetary Annihilation TITANS in-game [Community Mods](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1417396826).

## [FAQ]

**Can I use these personalities with lower difficulties?**

No. In game terms all the difficulty levels are in fact personalities. These personalities are modifications of the Absurd personality.

**Can I use an AI mod like Queller?**

Yes, though these personalities will use the vanilla brain rather than Queller. The two mods will not interfere with one another.

**Does this replace Queller?**

No, this is completely separate. It's simply a way for you to better tailor your experience with the vanilla AI. It also works with PA Classic, which Queller does not.

**Will this work in multiplayer?**

Yes.

**Does this affect Galactic War?**

No. Use the Galactic War AI Overhaul mod for that.

## [Incompatible mods]

I'm not aware of any.
