# Penchant AI Readme

This mod works with Planetary Annihilation: TITANS. It introduces a number of new personalities for the vanilla AI, based off the Absurd difficulty level. Many of the personalities will work with faction mods such as Legion. Installing the Queller AI will not interfere with this mod.

## FAQ

**Can I use these personalities with lower difficulties?**

No. In game terms all the difficulty levels are in fact personalities. These personalities are modifications of the Absurd personality.

**Can I use an AI mod like Queller?**

Yes, though these personalities will use the vanilla brain rather than Queller. The two mods will not interfere with one another.

**Does this replace Queller?**

No, this is completely separate. It's simply a way for you to better tailor your experience with the vanilla AI. It also works with PA Classic, which Queller does not.

**Will this work in multiplayer?**

Yes.

**Does this affect Galactic War?**

No. Use the Galactic War AI Overhaul mod for that.

## Incompatible mods

I'm not aware of any.
